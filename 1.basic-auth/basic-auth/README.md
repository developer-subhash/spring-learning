# Basic spring auth
- install dependency spring-web for making rest API and spring security for securing spring application
- as soon as we add spring security dependency, all endpoints are secured automatically by spring application as spring see security dependency in classpth
- we need to add username in properties file - spring.security.username=subhash so that when we access any endpoint, a login page will popped up and we need to enter this username and password from console screen which is generated by spring when we start application
- we can also set password in properties file like - spring.security.user.password=sam then console generated password will not be generated by console as it see password in properties file

# Problem with this approach ?
- only one user can access , we can't keep more than one user in properties file.
- also, we don't have role based security like authorization
- so now we create config file for configuring security things
- after spring boot 3, spring security configuration has changed a lot , we are using this
- before spring boot 3, we used to extend webSecurityConfigAdapter and used to override config methods and other for customizing security configuration according to us.
- but after version 3, adapter class is not there, we create bean of UserDetailsService for authentication storing users
- and for authorization, we create bean SecurityFilterChain where we apply filter for different roles for different methods, class or url level security

- once we create userDetailsService bean with any user and password, now we can't use credential from properties file
